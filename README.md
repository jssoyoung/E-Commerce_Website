## Installation

The user will first be required to have a command-line application downloaded onto their computer or laptop. The user must also have node.js installed onto that device. Once they have these two downloaded, the user could type "npm i" into their terminal or window. This should install the dotenv, inquirer, and mysql package into the user's command-line application. Once these packages are finished being installed, the user can type in "node server.js". The user could then answer all of the questions within the command line to view or manage the department, roles, and employees in the company.
